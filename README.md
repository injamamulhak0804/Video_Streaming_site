# Debouncing:

    performance:
        -type = Allah is enough for me. (without debouncing = 21 letter * 1000 = 210000)
        -type = Allah is enough for me. (with debouncing = 3 API calls * 1000 people = 30000)

# Debouncing with 200ms:

    - if the difference betweeen 2 key strokes is 200ms < Decline API call.
    - if the difference between 2  key strokes is > 200ms make an API call.

# converting the numbeers into 2142543 into k and views

logic:

- if a number length is greater than 3 and less than 6 is know as k.
- other are M
